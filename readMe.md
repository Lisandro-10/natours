# Natours App

This project is part of my learning journey in a backend course with Express, Node.js, and MongoDB. It focuses on developing a web application using modern technologies for server-side development and database management. The course covers fundamental concepts of Express and Node.js as well as advanced techniques for handling data with MongoDB.

## Description

The project involves building a web application using Express.js for server creation, Node.js for server-side runtime environment, and MongoDB as a NoSQL database. Throughout the course, we will learn to implement key functionalities for the backend of an application, such as user management, authentication and authorization, data manipulation, and the creation of RESTful APIs.

## Course Objectives

-   Learn to set up a web server using Express.js.
-   Implement routes and controllers to handle HTTP requests.
-   Integrate MongoDB as a database to store and retrieve data.
-   Develop essential backend functionalities, such as user management and authentication.
-   Build a RESTful API to interact with the application from the frontend.

### Technologies Used

-   Express.js
-   Node.js
-   MongoDB
-   JavaScript

This project provides an excellent opportunity to gain practical skills in web application development with modern backend technologies. Join me on this learning journey and discover the power of Express, Node.js, and MongoDB in building scalable and robust applications!
