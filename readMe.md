# Node.js, Express, and MongoDB Course Project

Welcome to the Node.js, Express, and MongoDB Bootcamp project! This repository contains the codebase developed as part of a comprehensive backend course focusing on Express, Node.js, and MongoDB.

Throughout this course, I embarked on a journey to master modern backend development with JavaScript. From building RESTful APIs to server-side rendering, I learned the ins and outs of Node.js and its related technologies.

## Project Overview

This project is the culmination of a complete, hands-on learning experience. As a student, I delved into the depths of backend development, crafting a feature-rich application that combines a RESTful API with a server-side rendered website.

By working on this extensive project, I gained proficiency in various areas, including:

-   Setting up a robust server using Express.js
-   Implementing advanced features like filtering, sorting, and pagination in RESTful APIs
-   Leveraging MongoDB for data storage and retrieval, both locally and on the cloud
-   Building authentication systems with JWT for secure user sign-up, login, and password reset
-   Exploring authorization concepts and user roles
-   Ensuring application security through encryption, sanitization, and rate limiting
-   Integrating third-party services like Stripe for credit card payments and Sendgrid for email sending
-   Deploying Node.js applications to production environments using platforms like Heroku
-   Collaborating with Git and GitHub for version control and project management

## Course Highlights

This course offered a comprehensive curriculum covering fundamental concepts as well as advanced techniques in backend development. Some highlights include:

-   Understanding the event-driven architecture and event loop in Node.js
-   Mastering Express.js for routing, middleware, and server responses
-   Exploring the NoSQL data model and performing CRUD operations with MongoDB
-   Deep diving into Mongoose for data modeling, validation, and middleware
-   Implementing MVC architecture for scalable and maintainable codebases
